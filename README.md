monads-in-clojure
=================

Back in 2009 I wrote a four-part tutorial on monads for Clojure
programmers. It can be considered an introduction to the
[algo.monads](http://github.com/clojure/algo.monads) library.

The tutorial was published on a blog hosted at
[onclojure.com](http://onclojure.com), which seems to have disappeared
in the meantime. @danboykis recovered it from
[archive.org](http://archive.org/) and reformatted it in Markdown,
ready for reading right here on GitHub. For now this repository
contains just this copy of the original tutorial, but I may
update it in the future.
